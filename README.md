## Description:
### The *GEOEYE-70* dataset is a meticulously curated collection of Earth observation data acquired from various satellites. It offers high-resolution imagery, ideal for capturing detailed features of Earth's surface, including diverse landscapes and cityscapes. Notably, this dataset was established in April 2024 as the foundation for testing pre-trained models in Vision Transformer technology.

### The *GEOEYE-70* dataset incorporates high-resolution imagery captured by various Earth-orbiting satellites, including Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR.

### The *GEOEYE-70* dataset originates from a diverse range of global, thematic, and specialized data collections. Let's explore its specific sources:
